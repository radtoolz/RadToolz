  7H  c  {+7}H is the nucleus with, by far, the most unbalanced neutron to      
  7H 2c  proton ratio. The first experimental indication of {+7}H being a       
  7H 3c  resonant state came in 2003 from RIKEN (2003Ko11). This study argued   
  7H 4c  that it is unlikely that {+7}H exists as a bound state, but a resonant 
  7H 5c  state near the {+3}H+4n threshold with J{+|p}=1/2{++} seems likely.    
  7H 6c  It was assumed that such a state would likely decay either into five   
  7H 7c  outgoing particles ({+3}H+4n) or two particles ({+3}H+{+4}n) if the    
  7H 8c  tetraneutron exists.                                                   
  7H  c  Most recent observations (2020Be01, 2021Mu04, 2021Hu28, 2022Ca10, and  
  7H 2c  2023Ni06) indicate that {+7}H ground state is a low-lying, narrow      
  7H 3c  (due to neutron pairing) resonance 1.3 MeV {I4} above the {+3}H+4n     
  7H 4c  mass with a width of |G<300 keV (2020Be01), and with J{+|p}=1/2{++}    
  7H 5c  measured in (2022Ca10). Such a state would be consistent with an       
  7H 6c  extended 4-neutron halo interacting with a {+3}H core, which would     
  7H 7c  decay by emission of a tetraneutron. The decay of the                  
  7H 8c  four-neutron-unbound ground state of {+7}H via direct emission of a    
  7H 9c  tetraneutron has not yet been experimentally observed. However, the    
  7H ac  ongoing analysis of (2021Hu28) seems to be suggestive of this mode of  
  7H bc  decay.                                                                 
  7H  c  As for the excited states of {+7}H, the first one is observed |J4 MeV  
  7H 2c  above the ground state with a plausible J{+|p}=(5/2{++}) assignment.   
  7H 3c  This state is expected (2021Mu04) to decay via {+5}H{-g.s.}+2n, where  
  7H 4c  {+5}H{-g.s.}, in turn, decays to {+3}H+2n. So, the decay may be        
  7H 5c  sequential. The first excited state may be part of a doublet containing
  7H 6c  another state at higher energy with J{+|p}=(3/2{++}). A candidate state
  7H 7c  for the latter was reported in (2021Mu04) but its existence is         
  7H 8c  uncertain. An even higher energy excited state was observed in         
  7H 9c  (2021Mu04) at 9.7 MeV, whose structure may be indicative of the p+6n   
  7H ac  configuration.                                                         
  7H  c                                                                         
  7H  c  {ITheory}: Numerous investigations have been carried out to study the  
  7H 2c  {+7}H{-g.s.} properties. These are summarized below.                   
  7H  c  1985Po10: An early shell model calculation obtained J{+|p}=1/2{++}     
  7H 2c  for the {+7}H ground state using two different models.                 
  7H  c  2000Fi22: Using resonating-group method, the wave function of {+7}H    
  7H 2c  as a cluster system of {+3}H+n+n+n+n was calculated and analyzed       
  7H 3c  hyperharmonically.                                                     
  7H  c  2002Ti05: Calculations using the 7-body hyperspherical                 
  7H 2c  harmonics functions with no core shell model predicted a {+7}H         
  7H 3c  binding energy of -7.61 MeV, estimated by exponential extrapolation.   
  7H 4c  This estimation was about 300 keV lower than that for {+5}H (2001Ko52),
  7H 5c  which would agree with the hypothesis of (2001Ko52) that {+7}H may     
  7H 6c  exist as a low lying resonance with the only decay channel being       
  7H 7c  {+7}H |) {+3}H+n+n+n+n. Later, (2004Ti02) performed the same kind of   
  7H 8c  calculations after improving a Casimir operator such that the          
  7H 9c  hyperharmonics had well defined symmetry when constructed within the   
  7H ac  shell model approach. This work deduced the {+7}H resonance |J3 MeV    
  7H bc  above the {+3}H+4n threshold. This theoretical result also favored a   
  7H cc  sequential decay of {+7}H into {+3}H+n+n+n+n.                          
  7H  c  2004Ao05: A coupled channels calculation treated {+7}H as a            
  7H 2c  combination of both a triton plus four neutrons and as a proton        
  7H 3c  plus three dineutrons. The calculated ground state binding energy is   
  7H 4c  about 1.5 MeV, which is about 7 MeV above the {+3}H+4n threshold.      
  7H  c  2009Ao03: This calculation used the Antisymmetrised Molecular          
  7H 2c  Dynamics with generator coordinate and stochastic variational methods  
  7H 3c  that included basis states with a triton and two dineutrons as well as 
  7H 4c  basis states with a triton and 4 neutrons. This study obtained a {+7}H 
  7H 5c  ground state with a binding energy of 2.8 MeV, which is about 4.2 MeV  
  7H 6c  above the {+3}H+4n threshold. This work describes the ground state of

  7H 8c  bosons bound together by their interaction with the {+3}H core in a    
  7H 9c  di-neutron condensate.                                                 
  7H  c  2011Gr13: Simultaneous four neutron emission by {+7}H is discussed     
  7H 2c  in this work. They demonstrate, by using simplified 3-body and 5-body  
  7H 3c  Hamiltonians, that few body dynamics of 2n and 4n emissions result in  
  7H 4c  collective barriers that rise quickly with increasing the number of    
  7H 5c  emitted particles. This translates into longer lifetimes being expected
  7H 6c  for nuclei which decay via 4n than those that decay via the emission   
  7H 7c  of 2n. This work considered the {+7}H{-g.s.} as a true 4n emitter and  
  7H 8c  estimated that the ground state of {+7}H has a narrow width of         
  7H 9c  |G|<1 keV.                                                             
  7H  c  2019Sh36: Simultaneous non-sequential 4n emission is considered in     
  7H 2c  a phenomenological five-body (core+4n) decay. This theoretical work    
  7H 3c  assumes that the internal structure of the ground state of {+7}H is    
  7H 4c  dominated by a 0{Ip}{-3/2}{+4} configuration. The decay of {+7}H may   
  7H 5c  cause a mixing of configurations such as 0{Is}{-1/2}{+2}0{Ip}{-3/2}{+2}
  7H 6c  due to Pauli focusing effect. This would result in correlations in     
  7H 7c  energy, angular distribution, and phase space, which could be used as  
  7H 8c  observable fingerprints of a simultaneous non-sequential 4n decay and  
  7H 9c  to understand the decay dynamics.                                      
  7H  c  2021Li62: The energies and neutron-emission widths of the unbound      
  7H 2c  hydrogen isotopes were computed using the no core Gamow                
  7H 3c  shell model. The ground state of {+7}H was considered as a rigid {+3}H 
  7H 4c  core and 4 valence neutrons (coupled to J=0), which immediately gives  
  7H 5c  J{+|p}({+7}H{-g.s.})=1/2{++}. The many body basis of the Gamow shell   
  7H 6c  model for the {+7}H{-g.s.} was generated from natural orbitals. The    
  7H 7c  resonance energy of {+7}H was deduced. The results vary between 1-3    
  7H 8c  MeV with an uncertainty of 400-600 keV, depending on the different     
  7H 9c  phenomenological NN interactions used. These results are more or less  
  7H ac  in agreement with the previous experimental results. A width of        
  7H bc  |G|?0.1 MeV was deduced for the {+7}H{-g.s.}, and it was recommended   
  7H cc  that the ground state of {+7}H is a very narrow resonance due to the   
  7H dc  0{Ip}{-3/2} being a closed sub neutron shell in {+7}H.                 
  7H  c  2022Hi06: The ground state of {+7}H was considered as a five-body      
  7H 2c  consisting of a solid {+3}H core interacting with 4 valence neutrons.  
  7H 3c  The properties of the {+7}H{-g.s.} were computed in the 5-body cluster 
  7H 4c  approximation ({+3}H-n-n-n-n), which is considered to be the dominant  
  7H 5c  decay channel for a low energy resonant state. A n-{+3}H local         
  7H 6c  interaction was constructed without any tensor component and adjusted  
  7H 7c  in order to reproduce the n-{+3}H phase shifts. These were calculated  
  7H 8c  by solving the ab-initio four-nucleon scattering problem. The Gaussian 
  7H 9c  Expansion Method was used to solve the five-body Schr~odinger          
  7H ac  equation for the {+3}H-n-n-n-n system. The Stabilization Method was    
  7H bc  used to estimate the complex energies of the {+7}H resonant state. As  
  7H cc  a result, instead of a narrow {+7}H resonant state in the vicinity of  
  7H dc  the {+3}H+4n threshold, a resonance was found at 9.5 MeV with a width  
  7H ec  of |G=3.5 MeV. This result is in agreement with that of (2004Ao05), but
  7H fc  it is in sharp contrast with the result of (2021Li62). The authors of  
  7H gc  (2022Hi06) argue that the Gamow shell model used in (2021Li62)         
  7H hc  underestimates the width. The results of (2022Hi06) are also           
  7H ic  inconsistent with the recent experimental results for the {+7}H{-g.s.} 
  7H jc  (2003Ko11, 2007Ca28, 2010Ni10, 2020Be01). Thus, it was mentioned in    
  7H kc  (2022Hi06) that the deduced wide resonance at 9.5 MeV may be linked to 
  7H lc  the experimental results of (2020Be01), where a resonance was found at 
  7H mc  E=6.5 MeV {I5} with a width of |G=2.0 MeV {I5}. It should be noted     
  7H nc  that the 6.5 MeV state measured in (2020Be01) is an unresolved doublet 
  7H oc  consisting of the first excited state and a candidate for the second   
  7H pc  excited state of {+7}H.

  7H 4cL {+7}H, which are accounted for in the analysis of (2020Be01, 2021Mu04).
  7H 5cL However, the missing mass spectrum displayed on Fig. 3 of (2022Ca10)   
  7H 6cL shows two wide peaks corresponding to the production of {+7}H from the 
  7H 7cL ({+8}He,{+3}He) reactions on {+19}F and {+12}C targets. These two peaks
  7H 8cL are |J5 MeV wide at FWHM (for the case of {+19}F({+8}He,{+3}He)) and   
  7H 9cL several MeV wide at FWHM (related to the {+12}C contribution). Such a  
  7H acL wide range may already include at least the first excited state of     
  7H bcL {+7}H. So, it is unclear (a) why (2022Ca10) did not consider any

  7H 7c  p({+8}He, 2p) reaction were tracked by the Time Projection Chamber     
  7H 8c  surrounding MINOS and were detected in coincidence by an array of 36   
  7H 9c  NaI crystals arranged in two symmetric rings around MINOS. The energy  
  7H ac  resolution of these scintillators was 1% (FWHM) at E{-p}=80 MeV. The

  7H cc  dipole magnet. Its associated focal plane detectors measured the       
  7H dc  energy loss and time-of-flight of the tritons. Neutrons' time-of-flight
  7H ec  and positions were detected by two plastic scintillator arrays: the    
  7H fc  NeuLAND demonstrator from GSI and the NEBULA array, placed downstream  
  7H gc  of SAMURAI at |q=0|'. These arrays together provide the highest 4n     
  7H hc  detection efficiency (|J0.6% at decay energy of 1 MeV).

  7H 2c  from multiple hits produced by the background neutrons. Ongoing

  7H 4c  7-body kinematics of the final state (2p+{+3}H+4n). Their preliminary

  7H 3c  9789814472487, 2007, pp. 18-25: A 15.3 MeV/nucleon {+8}He beam is      
  7H 4c  produced, at the GANIL-SPIRAL facility, by fragmentation of a {+13}C   
  7H 5c  bombarding a thick carbon target. The {+8}He beam impinged on an       
  7H 6c  isotopically enriched deuterated polypropylene target. The missing     
  7H 7c  mass spectrum of {+7}H is deduced from kinetic energies and emission   
  7H 8c  angles of the {+3}He ejectiles detected by the Silicon array MUST.     
  7H 9c  The earlier analysis of these data by (2007FoZY, 2007FoZX) indicated   
  7H ac  that a broad structure was observed at |J2 MeV above the {+3}H+4n      
  7H bc  emission threshold, which was proposed to be the ground state of {+7}H.
  7H cc  Two months later, Baumel {Iet al}. reported a candidate resonance      
  7H dc  observed at 1.56 MeV {I27} above the {+3}H+4n mass with a width of     
  7H ec  |G=1.74 MeV {I72}. These results have not been published in a          
  7H fc  peer-reviewed journal. Also, unlike more modern measurements, these    
  7H gc  inclusive {+2}H({+8}He,{+3}He) results did not require an exclusive    
  7H hc  triton coincidence with the {+3}He reaction products, which would      
  7H ic  select the correct {+7}H decay channel ({+3}H+4n). Therefore, these    
  7H jc  results were excluded from the adopted levels of {+7}H presented in    
  7H kc  this evaluation.                                                       
  7H  c  2010Ni10, 2010NiZT: The missing mass spectrum exhibits a shoulder      
  7H 2c  at around 2 MeV as well as a maximum around 10.5 MeV, relative to the  
  7H 3c  {+3}H+4n threshold. The maximum at 10.5 MeV could be an indication of  
  7H 4c  a {+7}H continuum excitation. They estimate the cross section of |J30  
  7H 5c  |mb/sr in the center of mass frame at |q{-c.m.}=6|'-14|' for the       
  7H 6c  reaction populating the low energy part of the {+7}H spectrum.

  7H  c  The above experiments did not show conclusive evidences. The first     
  7H 2c  quantitative results from studying the {+2}H({+8}He, {+3}He) reaction  
  7H 3c  comes from the (2020Be01) measurement.                                 
  7H  c  2020Be01: A 26 MeV/nucleon {+8}He beam is produced using the           
  7H 2c  ACCULINNA-2 fragment separator at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear     
  7H 3c  Reactions (JINR) to study the {+2}H({+8}He, {+3}He){+7}H reaction. The 
  7H 4c  {+3}He reaction products and the tritons from the decay of {+7}H are   
  7H 5c  momentum analyzed by a set of position sensitive |DE-E-E telescopes    
  7H 6c  covering an angular range of |q=8|'-26|', and a position sensitive     
  7H 7c  silicon detector backed by a set of CsI(Tl) crystals coupled to PMTs   
  7H 8c  positioned at |q=0|', respectively. A total of 105 [later changed to   
  7H 9c  119 in (2021Mu04)] {+3}He-{+3}H events are measured in coincidence     
  7H ac  mode.                                                                  
  7H  c  Analysis of the {+7}H missing mass spectrum with a 1.1 MeV resolution  
  7H 2c  (FWHM) and two binning factors (events/0.3 MeV and events/1.25 MeV)    
  7H 3c  is performed. The missing mass spectrum with the events/1.25 MeV       
  7H 4c  binning factor shows peaks at (i) E{-T}=1.8 MeV {I5} (5 events) with   
  7H 5c  |G<300 keV (E{-T} is energy relative to the {+3}H+4n threshold), (ii)  
  7H 6c  E{-T}=6.5 MeV {I5} with |G=2.0 MeV {I5} (27 events), and (iii)         
  7H 7c  E{-T}=12 MeV with |G=4 MeV. The experimenters interpret the            
  7H 8c  E{-T}=1.8 MeV peak as the ground state of {+7}H with an experimental   
  7H 9c  cross section of |J25 |mb/sr in the |q{-c.m.}=17|'-27|'. They          
  7H ac  consider the peak at E{-T}=6.5 MeV to be the first excited state of    
  7H bc  {+7}H and conclude that this state is either a J{+|p}=3/2{++} or       
  7H cc  5/2{++} state, or an unresolved doublet encompassing both of these     
  7H dc  states built upon the 2{++} excitation of valence neutrons. The        
  7H ec  average experimental cross section of this state is estimated to be    
  7H fc  30 |mb/sr over |q{-c.m.}=10|'-45|'. The authors advise that the peak   
  7H gc  at E{-T}=12 MeV could be produced as a result of a rapid decrease in   
  7H hc  the detection efficiency combined with growing 5-body (from the        
  7H ic  decay of {+7}H) phase space effects, which would complicate the        
  7H jc  spectrum. This study deduced theoretical differential cross            
  7H kc  sections using FRESCO for a J{+|p}=1/2{++} for the ground state and    
  7H lc  a J{+|p}=3/2{++} and 5/2{++} for the first excited state. As a result, 
  7H mc  spectroscopic factors of |J0.08-0.12 for the {+7}H ground state and    
  7H nc  |J1 for the population of the {+7}H first excited state are deduced.   
  7H oc  However, due to very low statistics for both states, these             
  7H pc  results may not be reliable.                                           
  7H  c  2021Mu04, 2023Ni06: These studies have an improved experimental setup  
  7H 2c  in comparison with the (2020Be01) experiment. A beam of 26             
  7H 3c  MeV/nucleon {+8}He ions, produced by fragmentation of a {+11}B primary 
  7H 4c  beam at the FLNR/JINR/ACCULINNA-2 (Dubna) fragment separator, impinged 
  7H 5c  on a windowed gas target filled with 1.13 atm (thick-mode) and 0.56    
  7H 6c  atm (thin-mode) D{-2} gas maintained at 27 K. It was assumed that beam 
  7H 7c  interacted with the target in the middle plane of the target. The      
  7H 8c  detection system was modified to increase angular coverage at lower    
  7H 9c  angles. The {+3}He reaction products and tritons from the decay of     
  7H ac  {+7}H were detected in coincidence (378 events) using 4 |DE-E-E (last  
  7H bc  one used as veto) telescopes consisting of single sided silicon strip  
  7H cc  detectors covering an angular range of |q{-lab}=6|'-24|' and a |DE-E   
  7H dc  telescope placed at |q{-lab}=0|' consisting of a double sided position 
  7H ec  sensitive silicon strip detector backed by 16 CsI(Tl) crystals coupled 
  7H fc  to PMTs, respectively. An array of 48 organic scintillator neutron     
  7H gc  detectors with 12 cm distance between each two were positioned along   
  7H hc  |q=0|'. This array had a 15% efficiency for single neutrons and a 2%   
  7H ic  efficiency for neutrons in coincidence with charged particles. The     
  7H jc  resolution of the array was 4.5%. The experimental resolution was      
  7H kc  deduced using Monte Carlo simulation validated by an independent       
  7H lc  reference measurement of d({+10}Be, {+3}He){+9}Li using the same       
  7H mc  setup. This reference measurement was also used to calibrate the {+7}H 
  7H nc  missing mass spectrum.                                                 
  7H  c  The missing mass spectrum was deduced from momenta of {+3}H and {+3}He 
  7H 2c  particles. Eight events were produced from the requirements of         
  7H 3c  {+3}He+{+3}H+n triple coincidences. The experimenters applied a cut on 
  7H 4c  the data for |q{-c.m.}>18|' because angular resolution rapidly degrades
  7H 5c  at higher angles. Moreover, data at higher angles are more affected by 
  7H 6c  the background. The missing mass spectrum reported in (2023Ni06) shows 
  7H 7c  two clear peaks as well as evidence for a higher energy third peak.    
  7H 8c  These peaks are evident in the spectrum of (2021Mu04). Furthermore,    
  7H 9c  in (2021Mu04), there is evidence of an additional higher energy peak.  
  7H  c  {IThe first peak - {+7}H{-g.s.}}: It exists at E{-T}=2.2 MeV {I5},     
  7H 2c  where E{-T} is decay energy above the {+3}H+4n threshold. This peak is 
  7H 3c  constructed from 9 events (2 events are from triple {+3}He-{+3}H-n     
  7H 4c  coincidences) associated to the {+7}H{-g.s.} with a theoretically      
  7H 5c  estimated width (2011Gr13) of |G|<1 keV. The measured angular          
  7H 6c  distribution is consistent with a one-step FRESCO calculation assuming 
  7H 7c  a J{+|p}=1/2{++} state and an extreme peripheral transfer.             
  7H  c  {IThe second and third peaks fitted as one peak}: The next region of   
  7H 2c  interest of the missing mass spectrum is the 3.5 |< E{-T} |< 9.5 MeV   
  7H 3c  region. If the events in this region are fitted with only one peak,    
  7H 4c  the result would be a peak at E{-T}=5.7 MeV with a width of |G=1.5 MeV 
  7H 5c  corresponding to the first excited state of {+7}H. However, assuming   
  7H 6c  that this state decays via the sequential decay of {+5}H{-g.s.} + 2n,  
  7H 7c  where {+5}H decays, in turn, via {+3}H+2n, the 1.5 MeV width of the    
  7H 8c  5.7 MeV state would be twice as large as the upper limit width of the  
  7H 9c  {+5}H{-g.s.} decay (Grigorenko, unpublished). Therefore, a more        
  7H ac  reasonable analysis involves fitting two peaks for the events in the   
  7H bc  3.5 |< E{-T} |< 9.5 MeV region of the missing mass spectrum.           
  7H  c  {IThe first and second excited states - the doublet}: When fitting 2   
  7H 2c  peaks under the above region, the first excited state is located at    
  7H 3c  E{-T}=5.45 MeV {I3} (|G=0.75 MeV). Two of the events from triple       
  7H 4c  {+3}He-{+3}H-n coincidences contribute to the formation of this state. 
  7H 5c  For the second excited state, two equally reasonable fits were         
  7H 6c  achieved both placing it at E{-T}=7.6 MeV {I3} but with a width of     
  7H 7c  |G=0.9 MeV or |G=2.7 MeV. Statistical arguments favor the fit with the 
  7H 8c  smaller width. The authors argue that the states at E{-T}=5.54 MeV and 
  7H 9c  7.6 MeV could be the 5/2{++} and 3/2{++} observed as an unresolved     
  7H ac  doublet in (2020Be01). However, they use caution for the state at      
  7H bc  E{-T}|J7.6 MeV since it could also originate from an asymmetric broad  
  7H cc  shoulder to the state at E{-T}|J5.45 MeV, or from two broad overlapping
  7H dc  states. It should be noted that only 1 {+3}He-{+3}H-n coincident event 
  7H ec  contribute to the formation of the second excited state. But the       
  7H fc  authors point out that the observation of this state does not have     
  7H gc  reasonable statistical confidence.                                     
  7H  c  {IThird excited state}: Lastly, the final peak in the missing mass     
  7H 2c  spectrum is located at E{-T}=11.0 MeV {I3} and contains 3              
  7H 3c  {+3}He-{+3}H-n coincidence events. This state is more prominent at     
  7H 4c  |q{-c.m.} between 20|'-35|' but in this region the background is       
  7H 5c  strong. The authors argue that this state may have a structure of a    
  7H 6c  dissolved core (p+6n, where the {+3}H core disintegrates into p+n+n).  
  7H 7c  A search for decay into p+6n was performed in (2021Mu04) but no        
  7H 8c  evidence was found. The authors deduced cross sections of |J24 |mb/sr  
  7H 9c  for |q{-c.m.}=5|'-9|' and |J7 |mb/sr for |q{-c.m.}=15|'-19|' (both for 
  7H ac  the ground state); and |J30 |mb/sr for |q{-c.m.}=5|'-18|' and |J11     
  7H bc  |mb/sr for |q{-c.m.}=18|'-30|' (both for the first excited state).

  7H 4c  the SPIRAL facility in GANIL, on a C{-4}H{-10} gas target. The {+13}N  
  7H 5c  and tritium (from {+7}H decay) charged reaction products are detected  
  7H 6c  in coincidence mode. Seven events are associated with {+7}H.           
  7H 7c  The energy of the ground state {+7}H resonance is                      
  7H 8c  determined to be E{-res}=0.57 MeV {I+42-21} above the {+3}H+4n         
  7H 9c  breakup threshold with a width of |G=0.09 MeV {I+94-6}. The            
  7H ac  uncertainties in E{-res} and |G are large because of the small number  
  7H bc  of observed events. These experiments do not report on the {+7}H spin  
  7H cc  and parity, and no reaction channel identification was possible.       
  7H dc  (2021Mu04) mentions that the results of these experiments are based on 
  7H ec  the assumption that only {+7}H{-g.s.} was populated. This assumption   
  7H fc  however may be questionable because of the potential for the           
  7H gc  populations of {+7}H*, as well as {+12}C({+8}He, {+14}N){+6}H, and     
  7H hc  {+12}C({+8}He, {+15}N){+5}H, which would complicate the detection of   
  7H ic  {+7}H{-g.s.} in the absence of the reaction channel identification.    
  7H  c  (2022Ca10): XUNDL dataset compiled by TUNL, 2023:                      
  7H 2c  The authors used the {+19}F({+8}He, {+20}Ne) and {+12}C({+8}He, {+13}N)
  7H 3c  reactions to investigate the ground state properties of {+7}H.         
  7H  c  A beam of {+8}He ions with an intensity of 10{+4} pps and an energy of 
  7H 2c  15.4 MeV/nucleon was produced in the SPIRAL facility at GANIL.         
  7H 3c  The beam impinged on the MAYA active-target detector filled with 176   
  7H 4c  mbar of a mixture of helium and Cf{-4}. The trajectories of the        
  7H 5c  {+20}Ne and {+13}N recoils were measured with an angular resolution of 
  7H 6c  1.2|'. The tritons from the decay of {+7}H were detected, in           
  7H 7c  coincidence with the recoils, in a |DE-E telescope composed of 20      
  7H 8c  silicon detectors backed by 80 CsI crystals.                           
  7H  c  In comparison with the {+19}F({+8}He,{+20}Ne) events, the missing mass 
  7H 2c  spectrum shows a less obvious peak associated to the contribution of   
  7H 3c  the {+12}C to the resonant formation of {+7}H. This peak is in a       
  7H 4c  region with a significant contribution from the lower tail of the      
  7H 5c  non-resonant continuum. An upper limit of 0.2 mb/sr was estimated for  
  7H 6c  the contributions other than those of the {+7}H and its non-resonance  
  7H 7c  continuum. The authors deduced the spectrum of ranges (16 mm           
  7H 8c  resolution at FWHM) for those recoils whose emission angles were       
  7H 9c  between |q{-lab}=45|'-54|'. This distribution shows a clear peak       
  7H ac  corresponding to the contribution of {+12}C to the formation of {+7}H. 
  7H bc  The peak was simulated with a Breit-Wigner probability distribution.   
  7H cc  The mass and width of the {+7}H resonance were extracted from a        
  7H dc  log-likelihood minimization between the simulation and the measured    
  7H ec  range distribution. The angular distribution of the {+7}H production   
  7H fc  with the {+12}C target was measured. DWBA calculations were performed  
  7H gc  with the code FRESCO. The average production cross section with the    
  7H hc  {+12}C yields 1.2 mb/sr {I+5-6} between |q{-c.m.}=6|' and 27|'.        
  7H ic  Systematic uncertainties are estimated to be |J0.7%. The measured      
  7H jc  angular distributions is rather featureless, and the DWBA fits         
  7H kc  suffered from large statistical and systematic uncertainties, which    
  7H lc  prevented a clear assignment of spin and parity.

  7H 2c  The authors describe the {+7}H nucleus as an extended pure neutron     
  7H 3c  shell around a {+3}H core in a 1/2{++} ground state. The neutron       
  7H 4c  pairing makes the {+7}H nucleus a long-lived and almost-bound          
  7H 5c  resonance.                                                             
  7H  c  In this experiment, more than 200 events were assigned to {+7}H{-g.s.} 
  7H 2c  (from the {+19}F({+8}He, {+20}Ne) and {+12}C({+8}He, {+13}N) reactions 
  7H 3c  measured), which is significantly higher than any other measurement.   
  7H 4c  The missing mass spectrum shows a prominent peak corresponding to the  
  7H 5c  resonant formation of {+7}H with the {+19}F target with a small        
  7H 6c  contribution from the lower tail of a 3-body non-resonant continuum,   
  7H 7c  as well as a less obvious peak corresponding to the {+12}C contribution
  7H 8c  to the production of {+7}H. The authors deduced the spectrum of ranges 
  7H 9c  (with 16 mm resolution at FWHM) for those recoils whose emission       
  7H ac  angles were between |q=45|'-54|' in the laboratory frame. This         
  7H bc  distribution shows two clear peaks (from {+19}F and {+12}C             
  7H cc  contributions) and was simulated with a Breit-Wigner probability       
  7H dc  distribution. The mass and width of the {+7}H resonance were extracted 
  7H ec  from a log-likelihood minimization between the simulation and the      
  7H fc  measured range distribution. The result describes {+7}H as a low-lying,
  7H gc  narrow (due to neutron pairing) resonance with a mass of 0.73 MeV      
  7H hc  {I+58-47} above the {+3}H+4n mass and a width of 0.18 MeV {I+47-16}.   
  7H ic  Owing to the large number of detected {+7}H events, most of which came 
  7H jc  from the reactions with the {+19}F target, the angular distribution    
  7H kc  of the {+7}H production with the {+19}F target was measured. The       
  7H lc  average production cross-section with {+19}F is 2.7 mb/sr {I5} between 
  7H mc  |q{-c.m.}=4|'-18|'. DWBA calculations were performed with the code

  7LI7c  transitions and |g-decay branching ratios (BRs) with the observed rate 
  7LI8c  of |b-rays. The strongest {+11}B transition is the 2125-keV |g ray from
  7LI9c  the first excited state to the ground state, which is directly fed and 
  7LIac  fed from higher-lying states.                                          
  7LI c  The delayed |a-particle spectrum was also measured. The interpretation 
  7LI2c  of this spectrum was complicated because the produced {+11}Be activity 
  7LI3c  was implanted into the target, and the observed energy                 
  7LI4c  depended on implantation depth, {+11}B parent level, emission angle    
  7LI5c  etc.. Analysis of the spectrum appeared most consistent with emission  
  7LI6c  from {+11}B*(9870). Two other potential |a-emitting states at          
  7LI7c  {+11}B*(10250,10380) were unfavored.                                   
  7LI c  The delayed |a Branching of 3.0% {I7} from {+11}B*(9870) to            
  7LI2c  {+7}Li{-g.s.} was deduced, based on an analysis that found an          
  7LI3c  intensity of 33% {I3} for the 2125-keV |g ray. Observed delayed        
  7LI4c  |a-particles were not found in coincidence with 478-keV |g-rays from   
  7LI5c  the first excited state of {+7}Li, but |a-particle emission to the     
  7LI6c  {+7}Li*(478) level could not be excluded because the relatively thick  
  7LI7c  targets could absorb the alphas before they reached the detector.      
  7LI8c  An upper limit of |< 5% feeding to the excited state was suggested.    
  7LI c  1981Al03: {+11}Be |b-delayed particle decays were measured using the   
  7LI2c  {+9}Be(t,p){+11}Be at E{-t}=3.4 MeV. The study was focused on          
  7LI3c  measuring the |b-delayed |a-particle branch. Thin {+9}Be foils         
  7LI4c  contained in a Helium-jet system permitted the capture of produced     
  7LI5c  activity in the He cell; the activity was then deposited on a counting 
  7LI6c  tape. The activity was transported to a counting area where Si and     
  7LI7c  NaI(Tl) detectors were used to measure delayed particles and |g-rays.  
  7LI c  |a particles and corresponding {+7}Li recoils ions were observed       
  7LI2c  both in singles and in coincidence with 478 keV |g-rays.               
  7LI3c  The |a-particle energy spectrum was unambiguously assigned to decay    
  7LI4c  from  {+11}B*(9870). The charged-particle spectrum observed            
  7LI5c  in coincidence with E{-|g}=485 keV {I10} provided evidence that some   
  7LI6c  small branching takes place from {+11}B*(9875) to the first            
  7LI7c  excited {+7}Li*(478) state; the Branching for this decay is 12.6%      
  7LI8c  {I12}. It is then concluded that the Branching of {+11}B*(9875) to     
  7LI9c  {+7}Li{-g.s.} is 87.4% {I12}. Compared with the well known E{-|g}=2125 
  7LIac  keV intensity (I=0.33 {I3}) and various cascades observed in the       
  7LIbc  {+11}Be(|b{+-}) decay scheme, the Branching of 2.9% {I4} to            
  7LIxc  {+11}B*(9875) was deduced.                                             
  7LI c  1982Mi08: {+11}Be |b-decay |g-ray activities were studied in the       
  7LI2c  {+9}Be(t,p){+11}Be reaction by bombarding a {+9}Be foil with 3.0-MeV   
  7LI3c  tritons. Ge(Li) and NaI(Tl) detectors and Pilot-B scintillation crystal
  7LI4c  were used to measure singles |g-ray, |g-|g coincidence and |b spectra  
  7LI5c  and |b-|g coincidences, respectively.                                  
  7LI c  The intensity of 2125-keV |g-decay of 0.370 {I25} was deduced.         
  7LI2c  Authors adopted the value of 0.355 {I18}, which is the average         
  7LI3c  of their value and the previous value of 0.33 {I3} (1971Al07).         
  7LI c  Comments: By normalizing the I{-|a}/I{-2125|g} of (1981Al03) to the    
  7LI2c  2125-keV |g-decay intensity=0.355 {I18} from (1982Mi08) a more precise 
  7LI3c  value of the |b-delayed |a-decay intensity, I{-|a}=0.031 {I4}, was     
  7LI4c  obtained. In (1981Al02) {+11}B*(9875) was found to decay with          
  7LI5c  Branching of 87.4% {I12} and 12.6% {I12} to {+7}Li*(0,478),            
  7LIxc  respectively.

  7BE7cL      (1982RuZV), and 53.12 d {I7} (1996Ja10).  In this analysis the    
  7BE7cL      uncertainty of 1982RuZV value                                     
  7BE8cL      was increased from 0.004 to 0.0088 so that its relative weight    
  7BE9cL      was reduced from 83% to 50%.  The weighted average of these       
  7BE0cL      values is 53.225 with an internal uncertainty of 0.006, a         
  7BEAcL      reduced-|h{+2} of 10.5, and an external uncertainty of 0.020.     
  7BEBcL      This uncertainty increased by the LRSW method to 0.06 so that     
  7BECcL      the most precise value of 53.284 is included; this uncertainty    
  7BEDcL      also includes the next most precise value of 53.16.               
  7BE cL T         The adopted half-life is dominated by the values of 1975La16,
  7BE2cL      1982ChZF, and 1982RuZV which contribute 10%, 39%, and 50% of the  
  7BE3cL      relative weight, respectively.  The values of 1982ChZF and        
  7BE4cL      1982RuZV differ by |? 10 |s and contribute 3.8 and 4.1 to the     
  7BE5cL      reduced-|h{+2} value of 10.5.  Since these three values differ    
  7BE6cL      by 0.12 days and the chemical forms in the latter two cases are   
  7BE7cL      not known, the chemical variation data in the above table suggest 
  7BE8cL      that some of this difference may be due to chemical affects.  This
  7BE9cL      suggests that the adopted uncertainty of 0.06 days is reasonable  
  7BE0cL for general use.                                                       
  7BE cL T         Values not used are: 54.5 d (J. F. Bonner, Jr., AEC report   
  7BE2cL      AECU-107 as quoted in 1953Kr16, no uncertainty); and 54.3 d {I5}  
  7BE3cL      (Bouchez, Daudel, Daudel, and Muxart, J. Phys. et Radium 8 (1947) 
  7BE4cL      336 as quoted in 1953Kr16, replaced by value of 1956Bo36); and    
  7BE5cL      53.694 d {I6}, 53.416 d {I6}, and 54.226 d {I6} (1999Hu20).  The  
  7BE6cL      values of 1999Hu20 have very small uncertainties and have very    
  7BE7cL      large variations, up to 1.5%, with chemical form which need to    
  7BE8cL      be confirmed.  If this large shift is correct, it would           
  7BE8cL      invalidate the uncertainty of our adopted value.

  7B  c  Evidence of the unbound {+7}B nucleus is observed in three             
  7B 2c  measurements. Each of these measurements is complicated by backgrounds,
  7B 3c  which affect the extraction of ground state properties. Since {+7}B is 
  7B 4c  unbound to 1p, 2p and 3p emission, the {+7}Li(|p{++},|p{+-})           
  7B 5c  measurements of (1981SeZR) are complicated by multi-body breakups that 
  7B 6c  add a phase-space background component to their analyzed spectra. The  
  7B 7c  {+10}B({+3}He,{+6}He) measurements of (1967Mc14) were complicated by a 
  7B 8c  rather large {+11}B({+3}He,{+6}He) background of {+8}B states along    
  7B 9c  with a multi-body breakup phase-space background component. Finally,   
  7B ac  the kinematically complete {+7}B analysis of {+9}Be({+9}C,{+7}B)       
  7B bc  reactions of (2011Ch32) are "contaminated" by {+9}Be({+9}C,{+8}C)      
  7B cc  events where one proton is unobserved.                                 
  7B  c  The corrections applied in 2012Ch32 appear to be the smallest, and     
  7B 2c  arguably most reliable, which perhaps explains that the 2012Wa38       
  7B 3c  mass evaluation has based the {+7}B mass excess on this value alone.   
  7B 4c  Without further experimental information, it is agreed that this is the
  7B 5c  best decision.

  7B  c  An apparently unpublished experimental result on {+7}Li(|p{++},|p{+-}) 
  7B 2c  is contained in a conference proceedings overview of pion induced      
  7B 3c  measurements carried out at the EPICS facility at LAMPF.               
  7B  c  The review indicates a 180 MeV |p{++} beam impinged on a {+7}Li target,
  7B 2c  and the reaction |p{+-} particles were momentum analyzed in a QQQDD    
  7B 3c  magnetic spectrometer. The missing mass spectrum is deduced.           
  7B  c  The missing mass spectrum shows a clear indication of the ground state,
  7B 2c  with some indication of a possible excited state. However, a broad     
  7B 3c  continuum background, attributed to multi-body phase-space breakups    
  7B 4c  could not be well fit with reasonable assumptions for {+4}He+3p,       
  7B 5c  {+5}Li+2p and {+6}Be+p contributions. A best fit to the data indicated 
  7B 6c  a mass excess of |DM=27.80 MeV {I10} with |G=1.2 MeV {I2} for the
