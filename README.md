Introducing RadToolz

RadToolz is a Microsoft Excel® add-in that brings several radiation safety equations into easy to implement functions:  These functions include:
* Half-life in seconds, minutes, hours, or years
* Specific activity in curies/gram
* Enumerates decay series
* Radioactive decay for series
* Dose conversion factors for inhalation and ingestion (ICRP 68 and 72)
* Simple Gaussian plume dispersion (χ/Q)
The add-in is free to use!  All I ask for is some constructive feedback to fix errors and improve functionality.
